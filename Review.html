            The taste of foods are so delicious and the atmosphere of the place is also nice.
            The service team are also helpful and so friendly.
            
            Thank you all for lovely memory and I'm sure I'm coming back here again.</td>

            An excellent meal in a beautiful setting. The food was very good value considering its high quality and presentation. We visited at lunch time and enjoyed the uninterrupted view of the lake and a peaceful but convivial atmosphere. My friends also raved about the chablis. High level of service and a very enjoyable experience overall.

            Inside there is a nice lounge area with around 40 bottles of fine wines you can taste from 10cl to full glasses rather than just buy one.
            A basement wine cellar leads to a lovely table for 4 in the cooler cellar.
            After a wonderful steak, so tender, i elected for the cheese board - it was more of a table on wheels, perhaps 40 choices.
            It was a midweek and 7.30pm visit so quieter than usual according to my colleagues but for later meals better to book in advance</td>
